# Map Demo
In this short workshop, each of you will learn how to map GPS data into a custom map. At the end you will have your own web page with something like this: http://1cgonza.github.io/mapdemo/

Before the class, please make sure you go through all of the following steps. We need to create accounts in different sites and download a few things. It is all free, so no worries.

###Map Tiles
1. Create a free account at https://www.mapbox.com
2. Download and install MapBox Studio from: https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/

###Code Editor
Any would do (Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++, Dreamweaver), so if you have one alredy you are good to go.
I personally use Sublime Text - http://www.sublimetext.com/3 -

###Free Web Hosting
1. Create a free account at https://github.com
2. Download and install their software:
 - MAC: https://mac.github.com/

###GPS Data
This I expect each of you to have it ready before class. 
- If you are using the schools tracker, bring the .GPX file. 
- If you are using google and your phone to track the locations, download the .KML from https://maps.google.com/locationhistory by clicking on the link "Export to KML".
